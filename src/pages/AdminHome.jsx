            <h2>Fall Lock System - Ensuring Borewell Safety</h2>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "14px" }}>
              Every year, numerous accidents occur due to uncovered borewells,
              putting innocent lives, especially children, at risk. FallLock
              System is a government-approved initiative that provides a
              temporary Borewell Safety Kit to secure open borewells,
              preventing tragic incidents. With our easy registration and
              request system, users can apply for a Borewell Safety Kit and
              contribute to making their surroundings safer. Once the borewell
              is permanently sealed, the kit must be returned to ensure its
              availability for others in need.
